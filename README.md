# nfl-betting-model

### This repository contains an exploratory project to determine if we can develop a model to accurately predict NFL home team and away team scores in order to place bets more confidently. We will also attempt to determine whether value exists in potential wagers by analyzing past sportsbook data, including weather patterns (wind speed, temperature, etc), venue type (indoor/outdoor), and line information.
